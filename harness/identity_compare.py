"""
Python port of burp-extension's IdentityCompareLogic.java (cross_identity_compare
/ authorization_boundary_compare decision logic). Direct, line-for-line port --
not a redesign -- so the already-proven design (source/candidate/attempt/anon
4-probe comparison with an anonymous-baseline check to rule out "this is just
a public resource") carries over exactly. Keep this in sync with the Java
original by hand; there is no shared source of truth between the two, the
same class of risk this project's own comments already flag elsewhere
(e.g. exchange_fingerprint()/exchangeFingerprint(), HarnessPanel.java's
IMPLEMENTED_BURP_CAPABILITIES).
