"""
Second-order confirmation primitives (V22 second-order SQLi, V17 second-order IDOR).

The confirmation legs in this harness share one shape: replay ~one request under a
different condition and diff against a baseline. That structurally cannot catch a
second-order bug, where a value is stored safely by request A and reused unsafely
by a DIFFERENT request B on an unrelated path (HARNESS_IMPROVEMENT_NOTES #3).
sqlmap is single-request; the cross-identity leg replays one request. Neither
models plant-A -> trigger-B.

This module supplies the missing plant->trigger DIFFERENTIALS as pure-ish
primitives over injected async callables, so the (A, B) pair the chain composer
identifies (chaining.py's second_order_* rules) can be actively confirmed without
baking the network into the oracle -- and the oracle is unit-tested with simulated
vulnerable/safe B endpoints, no live target.

  - confirm_second_order_sqli: plant a boolean-TRUE vs boolean-FALSE SQL marker
    via A, trigger B each time; if B's response depends on the planted boolean,
    the stored value reaches a SQL query on B -> confirmed second-order SQLi.
  - confirm_second_order_idor: plant a unique marker object as identity 1 via A,
    read via B as identity 2; if identity 2 sees identity 1's planted marker, the
    stored object crosses the identity boundary -> confirmed second-order IDOR.

Deterministic given the injected callables. The orchestrator supplies real,
scope-gated, gated (allow_mutating_replay) send callables; the plant is a mutating
write, so this only runs under the mutating opt-in.
